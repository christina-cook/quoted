# Quoted: A Friends Trivia App
Quoted is a web application built with React that allows users to play a fun, interactive trivia game on their desktop, tablet, or mobile device. The app uses a RESTful API to test a user's knowledge of the popular TV series Friends. To play, users match memorable quotes with the character who said it.

## Using the App

### How to Play

### Playing the Game

## Goals
The focus of this project was to build an application that demonstrates knowledge of React, React Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, and end-to-end testing with Cypress. 

## Challenges and Wins

**Challenges:** Hooks and functional components were utilized in the application; however, it was difficult to get the API data to display properly using the useEffect hook. A helper function proved to be easier to work with in the end. Targeting and removing class names on buttons was also challenging; some good ole vanilla JS seemed to be the best way, as opposed to setting something in state.

**Wins:** A lot of time was devoted to planning for this project. Personas and user stories were created to describe the target audience, and wireframes detailed the initial design plans. Daily goals were tracked and new issues were added to the project board to keep the developer on track throughout the project.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies/tools were used to develop this application:

- React, React Router
- REST API
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Cypress (integration testing)
- GitHub Projects

## Agile Workflow
An agile workflow was used while developing this app by utiilizing the Kanban board on Github Projects. 

Close to 30 tickets (user stories, bugs, new features, testing tickets) were converted into issues and tracked throughout the 6 day sprint. Detailed iterations and milestones were created to set and track goals.
