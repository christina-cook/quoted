# Quoted: A Friends Trivia App

Quoted is a web application built with React that allows users to play a fun, interactive trivia game on their desktop, tablet, or mobile device. The app uses a RESTful API containing memorable quotes from the TV series Friends to test a user's knowledge of the TV series by matching memorable quotes with the character who said it.
